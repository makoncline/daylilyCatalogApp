**Batteries included:**

- **Prebuilt user system** — supporting both username/password registration and
  OAuth / social authentication (Twitter, GitHub, Facebook, ...)
  - Register via email with sensible validation and error handling
  - Register via social
  - Verify email flow
  - Handle errors in email verification flow
  - Login (with mixed case username/email, or via social)
  - Email management (add more, delete old, change primary, resend verification)
  - `User.isVerified` to check they have at least on verified email (can use
    this to govern further permissions)
  - Update profile information
  - Change password flow
  - Forgot password flow
  - Unlinking social profiles
- **Ant Design Framework** — "A design system with values of Nature and
  Determinacy for better user experience of enterprise applications"
- **Preconfigured everything** - get started on developing without having to
  write boilerplate

- **Development speed:**

  - **Hot reloading** — edit a component and it's re-rendered immediately
    (warning: state is _not_ restored, because this typically leads to
    instability); provided by Next.js
  - **SSR with hot reloading** — if you turn JS off and reload the page you
    should be greeted with the same content anyway; provided by Next.js
  - **TypeScript** — make your project maintainable by starting with strong
    typing throughout
  - **Linting** — provided by `eslint`, `prettier` and `@typescript-eslint`. Can
    be extended with extremely powerful lint rules to protect your project from
    bugs, bad practices, and inconsistencies; configured with sensible but not
    too intrusive (hopefully) defaults focused on GraphQL development
  - **Autoformatting** ─ Thanks to `prettier` and `eslint`, code can be
    auto-formatted (and auto-fixed) on save
  - **Debuggability** ─ The server, worker, tests and client are all ready to be
    debugged using
    [VSCode's built in breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)

- ## **Best practices:**

-
- **React hooks** — modern react code
- **GraphQL** — on the backend through PostGraphile, on the frontend via Apollo
  client
- **Autogenerated Type-safe GraphQL Hooks** — using `graphql-code-generator` to
  turn your GraphQL queries and mutations into strongly typed React hooks
  instantly
- **PostGraphile configured for lean schema** — very tidy GraphQL schema,
  adhering to PostGraphile best practices
- Testing:
- **Database tests** — Jest configured to test the database, plus initial tests
  for various database functions and tables
- **GraphQL tests** — Jest configured to test the GraphQL schema, plus some
  initial tests
- **Acceptance tests** — implemented with Cypress

- [x] **Job queue** — we've added and configured
      <a href="https://github.com/graphile/worker">graphile-worker</a> to
      perform background tasks for you, such as sending emails, and included
      some example tasks
- [x] **Express server** — with Benjie's
      [easy to customize and understand middleware system](@app/server/src/index.ts)

- [x]
- [x]
- [x] **Productive roll-forward migrations** — we use
      <a href="https://github.com/graphile/migrate">graphile-migrate</a> for
      development speed, but you're welcome to switch to whatever migration
      library you like
- [x] **Realtime** — PostGraphile is configured with `@graphile/pg-pubsub` to
      enable Realtime events from the DB; and Apollo is configured to consume
      them
- [x] **Production build** — command to generate a production build of the
      project using `yarn run build`
- [x] **Production Docker build** — how to build a Docker image you could use in
      production
- [x] **Deployment instructions: Heroku** — how to deploy to Heroku

- [x] **Docker development flow** — enables work on this project using Docker
      (rather than running the Postgres/etc. directly on your machine)
- [x] **Documented error codes** — specification of existing error codes,
      examples of them being used, and space to add more

- [x] **Sessions** — to persist login information in the traditional way (with
      cookies)
- [x] **Responsive email templates** — we've added MJML and a templating system
      to help you format emails; all emails go through the `send_email` worker
      task so it's easy to customize
- [x] **Email transport** — we've configured Nodemailer to use ethereal.email to
      catch all development emails, and AWS' SES in production (easy to replace
      with a different provider thanks to Nodemailer)
- [x]
- [x]
- [x] **HTML→Text emails** — automated conversion from your pretty templates to
      plain text emails for users that prefer that
- [x] **Form validation** — using AntD's `Form` component

## TODO

Here's some more things we'd like to demonstrate that we've not got around to
yet. (If you're interested in helping, reach out on Discord:

- [ ] **File uploads** — user can change their avatar, but this approach can be
      extended to other areas
