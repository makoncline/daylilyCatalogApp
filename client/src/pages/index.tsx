      <p>
        This project can serve as a basis for your own project. We've added many
        features that most projects require, but you're free to remove them or
        replace them with whatever you need.
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
        <strong>Please read this page before continuing</strong> as it contains
        a lot of context.

      <h3>First user is admin</h3>
      <p>
        The first user to register will automatically have their "admin"
        property set true. Admin doesn't do anything in this starter, but you
        can use it in your own applications. To disable this, delete the
        database function{" "}
        <code>app_private.tg_users__make_first_user_admin()</code> and related
        triggers.
      </p>
      <h3>Not possible without your support</h3>
      <p>
        I really hope that this project wows you üòç and saves you huge amounts
        of time. I've certainly poured a lot of time into it! To help me to keep
        building and advancing projects like this, please join{" "}

      <h3>Page load delays: development only</h3>
      <p>
        We use Next.js to serve the React app. This gives us server-side
        rendering, routing, bundle splitting, hot reloading, and much more.
        However, in development when you visit a page it must first be loaded
        from the file system and transpiled and bundled by the server, served to
        the client, and then executed. This means there can be a small delay
        when loading a web page for the first time in development. In
        production, this delay should be vastly smaller, and can be eliminated
        with prefetching. You can read more about this in the{" "}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs#prefetching-pages">Next.js docs</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Page hangs: development only</h3>
      <p>
        If the page hangs this is likely because the Next server was restarted.
        Please reload the page.
      </p>
      <h3>Emails</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          In development we don't send any emails to real email addresses
        </strong>
        , instead all emails are sent to{" "}
        <a href="http://ethereal.email">ethereal.email</a> where you can browse
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep an eye on the terminal; when an email is triggered the server will
        log a URL to view the email.
      </p>
      <h3>
        This file: <code>client/src/pages/index.tsx</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This file is located in the client pages folder:{" "}
        <code>client/src/pages/</code>. If you edit this file and save, the page
        in the browser should automatically update.
      </p>
      <h3>
        The server: <code>backend/src/server/index.ts</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The entry point to the server is{" "}
        <code>backend/src/server/index.ts</code>; this creates an Express.js
        server and installs a number of middlewares, including PostGraphile.
      </p>
      <h3>Realtime</h3>
      <p>
        We've configured PostGraphile with @graphile/pg-pubsub to enable
        realtime events from the DB; and Apollo is configured to consume them.
        For example, if you register with email/password you may notice the red
        dot at the top right indicating that you need to verify your email. If
        you verify your email in another tab (or even another browser) you
        should notice that this dot disappears. Realtime ‚ú®üåà
      </p>
      <h3>Making it yours</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and extract a zip of the latest release from GitHub</li>
        <li>
          In that folder run:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>git init</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>git add .</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>git commit -m"PostGraphile starter base"</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the project name in <code>package.json</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the project settings in <code>backend/src/config.ts</code>
        </li>
        <li>Replace the README.md file</li>
        <li>Commit as you usually would</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        If you're happy with our user account system, we recommend that you
        commit this first migration with <code>yarn db:migrate commit</code>,
        and then set about making this application your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, click "login" at the top right, then choose "Register
        Here".

      <h2>Further notes</h2>
      <h3>Server-side rendering (SSR)</h3>
      <p>
        If you disable JS and reload the page you should see the content is
        still displayed (this "server-side rendering" is important to ensuring
        that your users have the best low-latency experience of your website,
        and that the majority of search engines can index its content).
      </p>
      <h3>Duplicate emails</h3>
      <p>
        To prevent people blocking legitimate users from registering, we only
        prevent the same email address being used multiple times when it has
        been verified by someone. It's up to your application to turn features
        off/etc when the user does not have any verified email addresses (should
        you desire this).
      </p>
      <h3>Email in production</h3>
      <p>
        We've configured the project to use Amazon SES to send emails in
        production (you will need to create the relevant resources and provide
        the relevant secrets to use this); however it can easily be reconfigured
        to use your email transport service of choice.
      </p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://ant.design/components/form/">AntD's forms</a>,
        so validation is provided via these. We've shown how to connect
        server-side errors into the form validation, for example try registering
        a new account using the email address of an account{" "}
        <strong>that has already been verified</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3>One-time clone: no such thing as breaking changes</h3>
      <p>
        It's expected that you'll do a one-time clone of this project to base
        your project off, and that you will not keep your project up to date
        with this one. As such, we can make any changes we like to this project
        without breaking your project.
